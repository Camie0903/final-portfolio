      I've spent 2 years in the coding industry, I found my passion through working with the coding language HTML and today i can say that I have learnt much more and I find coding much more intriguing, 
      everyday is something new to learn. All that I am and all I can do was all through practice.

      Since I've been coding I always lived up to this specific words of Steve Jobs, <i>"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. 
      It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully."</i>
